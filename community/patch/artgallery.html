            <img src="./images/tatoStickers.png" height="400" alt="a drawing of a tato, festooned with stickers in the shapes of: a book, a bee, a butterfly, two yellow five-pointed stars, and a brachiosaurus. these are the types of stickers with which you would adorn a sturdy waterbottle brought on a dayhike or a late night study session at the library. the tato is suspended in space. it soars over its ancestral livery: fifteen parallel lines in varying pastels, atop a white field. the brachiosaur looks over its shoulder; is it expectantly scanning the horizon for the foliage it so craves...or surveilling the allosaurus sticker that pursues it from the dark side of the tato?">
